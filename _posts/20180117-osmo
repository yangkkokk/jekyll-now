You will need to clone a fork of GR-GSM from GitHub:
>  https://github.com/axilirator/gr-gsm/tree/fixeria/trx
>  I am going to send a pull request, as soon as I finish
>  some things and clean up the code according to your
>  requirements.
>
>   2) Build GR-GSM as usually, and you will see a new GNURadio
>  block named 'TRX Interface' in gnuradio-companion.
>
>   3) Clone my branch of OsmocomBB:
>  git clone git://git.osmocom.org/osmocom-bb -b fixeria/sdr_phy
>
>   4) Make sure you have a fresh version of libosmocore, and build
>  OsmocomBB without firmware (we don't need it anymore):
>
>  cd osmocom-bb/src/
>  make nofirmware
>
>   5) Go to the 'apps/trx/' directory, and launch the 'grgsm_trx.py'
>  application. One will init a simple follow graph and actual
>  TRX interface.
>
>   6) Go to the 'osmocom-bb/src/host/trxcon/' directory, and run
>  the 'trxcon' application, which is used to connect OsmocomBB
>  L2&3 applications with transceiver application.
>
>  ./trxcon -d DAPP:DL1C:DSCH
>
>   7) Go to the 'osmocom-bb/src/host/layer23/src/misc/' directory
>  and run the 'ccch_scan' application, and you will see how
>  it actually works ;)
>
>  ./ccch_scan -a ARFCN -i 127.0.0.1
